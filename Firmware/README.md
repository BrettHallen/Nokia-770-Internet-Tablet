To execute the flasher under Mac OS you need to do the following:
- Requires a Power PC Mac or an earlier Intel Mac with Rosetta: ```Mach-O executable ppc```
- Ensure the file has execute permissions: ```chmod +x flasher-2.0.macosx```

To be continued if I can get a Power PC Mac up and running, or an Intel Mac running Rosetta ...
