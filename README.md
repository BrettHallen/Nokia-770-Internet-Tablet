## [Red Pill Mode](http://wiki.maemo.org/Red_Pill_mode)
Red Pill is an Application manager mode that disables certain safety features, and allows access to certain additional settings.<br>

It changes the way Application manager behaves, primarily by removing many of the safety locks that prevent users from installing harmful packages, or upgrading or replacing important system packages (which can result in reboot loops).<br>

It also hides packages that aren't relevant to users, and shows additional settings to tweak specific behaviors (like whether to cache packages to the internal memory card during installation).<br>

### WARNING/HUOM!
Red Pill is not intended for use by users, power-users, nor the vast majority of developers.<br>

Red Pill mode is very likely to break your tablet and should not be used unless you know exactly what you are doing.<br>

### Steps
To get Red Pill mode in Application Manager:
- Open Application Manager
- Go to "Tools" then "Application Catalogue"
- Click "New"
- Type ```matrix``` into the "Web Address" field
- Click "Cancel"
- Tap "Red" in the dialogue box to enable Red Pill mode, or "Blue" to remain in the standard more or to disable Red Pill mode.
